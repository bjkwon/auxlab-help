<h1 id="main">Timeshift operation in AUX</h1>
<p id="main">Suppose you have a 25-Hz tone with the duration of half second.</p>
<p id="main">Then you have another tone, octave higher, with the duration of 250 ms, but it starts 100 ms after the first tone ends.</p>
<p id="main">The first one is</p>
<img src="timeshift_files/image004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_s1037" width="562" height="150">
<p id="main">In AUX this is</p>
<p><big><strong><font face="Courier New" color="blue">tone(25,500)</font></strong></big></p>
<p id="main">meaning that it is 25 Hz with the duration of 500 ms.</p>
<p id="main">The second tone is</p>
<img src="timeshift_files/image006.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_s1039" width="562" height="150">
<p id="main">In AUX this is</p>
<p><big><strong><font face="Courier New" color="blue">tone(25,500) >> 600</font></strong></big></p>
<p id="main">meaning that it is 50 Hz with the duration of 250 ms and it starts at 600 ms.</p>
<p id="main">"<font face="Courier New">&gt;&gt;</font></strong>" is the "time-shift" operator, indicating that the signal starts at the specified time point.</p>
<p id="main">So if you need to "add" these two sounds, just add them like this:</p>
<p><big><strong><font face="Courier New" color="blue">tone(25,500) + tone(25,500) >> 600</font></strong></big></p>
<p id="main">There the "<b><font face="Courier New">+</font></b>" operation in AUX indicates an addition of conceptual elements of sound units, rather than a vector/matrix operation in MATLAB. If you are a MATLAB user, this might sound weird, but remember&mdash;this relieves the users of the burden of vector preparation for representing a combinations of sound units. If you are not, just enjoy the AUX scripting at a conceptual level of sound design/representation/processing.</p>
<p id="main">If the two tones overlap in time, still no worry. Just put them together however way you want to arrange them temporally, for example:</p>
<p><big><strong><font face="Courier New" color="blue">tone(25,500) + tone(25,500) >> 250</font></strong></big></p>
<p id="main">What should this be? Think about it and <a href="whatisaux_files/tone%2825,500%29+tone%2850,500%29shifted250.JPG">click here</a> when you are ready.</p>
