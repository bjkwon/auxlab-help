<h1>Introduction to AUXLAB</h1>
<h3>version 1.7</h3>

<font face="Arial"><p>
AUXLAB is an integrated environment for sound generation, processing, visualization and audio playback, based on a programming language AUX (AUdio syntaX). AUXLAB allows audio manipulations, plotting of audio and non-audio data, playback of audio data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces and interfacing with programs written in other programming languages such as C/C++ and MATLAB. 
</p><p>
Although AUXLAB is primarily intended for audio processing, it offers versatile functionalities allowing the users to compute and handle non-audio data.
</p><p>While the syntax of AUXLAB resembles that of MATLAB, there are many unique syntax features of AUXLAB and differences in syntax conventions.
</p><p>This is a work in progress, more so for documentation. The following is the list of features of the software that are not yet included in this documentation. 
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>User defined functions, general (how-to info) info and the Debugger feature</li>
<li>Custom user interface module--you can design your own window components (dialog box, buttons, etc), so you can create your own program to be used for an experimental procedure with functionalities of AUX playback and graphics</li>
<li>Complete descriptions on properties of graphics objects---Smilar to MATLAB, but with numerous differences to note</li>
<li>"# Reserves"--special keywords assigned to frequently performed tasks or operations</li>
</ul>
