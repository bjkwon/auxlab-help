<h1>Operators in AUX</h1>

<font face="Arial"><p>
 In addition to arithmetic operators (+ - * / ^ %) and logical operators (&& || !), that you can find in most programming or scripting languages, AUX offers unique operators designed for audio signals, such as @ (amplitude scaling), >> (time-shift), ~ (time-compression/spectrum-expansion), -> (spectrum-shift), &lt&gt (change of duration), and # (change of pitch).
