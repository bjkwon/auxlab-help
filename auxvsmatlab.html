<title>AUX vs MATLAB</title>

<p id="main">So, you always need to check the lengths of vectors or sizes of matrices all the time when using in MATLAB. What a pain! Are these considerations really critical in the conception of the sound? Probably not. If all you need is to create the sound and study the perception of it, you really don't need to consider it at a sample-by-sample level.</p>
<p id="main">In AUX, it is always X+Y. Period. No need to worry about the lengths.</p>
<p id="main">Wait a minute, what happens if X and Y have different durations?</p>
<p id="main">You are asking this question because you are probably still thinking about vector/matrix operations as in MATLAB. In AUX, you consider the elements of sound, not vectors/matrix of digital samples.</p>
