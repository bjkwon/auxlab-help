[FUNCTION NAME] tsq_settimes
[STATIC] 0
[FUNCTION DESCRIPTION] Retrieves time points of a time sequence
[PARAMETERS] x time_points
[PARAM TYPE DELIM BY TAB] TSEQ	VCT
[PARAM DESCRIPTION--MULTILINES] time_sequence_input
An array of time point values; 
[PARAM UNIT--MULTILINES] N/A
milliseconds or none (for relative time base)
[NOTES] To update a millisecond-based input time sequence with relative time based time points, define a new time sequence with relative time base and use tsq_gettimes to pull up that relative time base and use it as the argument (This is only a temporary hack; a better policy should be in place in the future. 3/11/2019).
