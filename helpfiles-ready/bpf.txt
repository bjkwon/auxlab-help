[FUNCTION NAME] bpf
[STATIC] 0
[FUNCTION DESCRIPTION] IIR, band-pass filtering; Apply a band-pass filter to the audio signal
[PARAMETERS] x fcut1 fcut2 order=8 type=1 dBpass=.5 dBstop=-40
[PARAM TYPE DELIM BY TAB] AUDIO	SCAL	SCAL	SCAL	SCAL	SCAL	SCAL
[PARAM DESCRIPTION--MULTILINES] audio signal
cut-off frequency1
cut-off frequency2
order of the IIR filter
IIR filter type (1: Butterworth, 2: Chebyshev, 3: Elliptic)
Passband ripple allowed
Stopband attenuation
[PARAM UNIT--MULTILINES]

dB
dB
[NOTES] The output is not normalized; i.e., the rms of #p1 is adjusted according to the filter gain.
#p2 and #p3 should be less than the Nyquist frequency. 
IIR filter coefficients are designed by the specification <b>requested</b> in the argument list, <b>but not guranteed</b>. The user is responsible for making sure the output follows the spec.
