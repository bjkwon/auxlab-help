[FUNCTION NAME] atmost
[STATIC] 0
[FUNCTION DESCRIPTION] Apply an upper limit to the input; make it "at most" this value
[PARAMETERS] x limit
[PARAM TYPE DELIM BY TAB] SCAL or VCT	SCAL or VCT
[PARAM DESCRIPTION--MULTILINES] the input value or array
the limit to impose
[PARAM UNIT--MULTILINES]
n/a
[NOTES] For a matrix input, a row-wise operation is applied. That is, if limit is a scalar, it is applied to all rows; if it is a vector, each value in the limit vector is applied to each row until it is no longer available.
[EXAMPLES] x=[2 9 3 4]
x.atmost(5) =<br>2 5 3 4<br>
x=[2 9 3 4; 23 8 1 70; 201 400 623 300];
x.atmost([5 50 500]) =<br>2 5 3 4<br>23 8 1 50<br>201 400 600 300<p>
[ALGORITHM]
[SEE ALSO] atleast max min 
[OUTPUT ARGS BY TAB] y
[OUTPUT ARGS--MULTILINES] #q1 is the matrix, vector, or scalar of the same size as #p1
