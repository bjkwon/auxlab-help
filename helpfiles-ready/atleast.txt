[FUNCTION NAME] atleast
[STATIC] 0
[FUNCTION DESCRIPTION] Apply a lower limit to the input; make it "at least" this value
[PARAMETERS] x limit
[PARAM TYPE DELIM BY TAB] SCAL or VCT	SCAL or VCT
[PARAM DESCRIPTION--MULTILINES] the input value or array
the limit to impose
[PARAM UNIT--MULTILINES]
n/a
[NOTES]For a matrix input, a row-wise operation is applied. That is, if limit is a scalar, it is applied to all rows; if it is a vector, each value in the limit vector is applied to each row until it is no longer available.
[EXAMPLES] x=[2 9 3 4; 23 8 1 70; 201 400 623 300];
x.atleast(10) =<br>10 10 10 10<br>23 10 10 70<br>201 400 623 300<p>
x.atleast([3.5 10 250]) =<br>3.5 9 3.5 4<br>23 10 10 70<br>250 400 623 300<p>

[OUTPUT ARGS BY TAB] y
[OUTPUT ARGS--MULTILINES] #q1 is the matrix, vector, or scalar of the same size as #p1
