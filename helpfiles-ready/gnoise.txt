[FUNCTION NAME] gnoise
[STATIC] 1
[FUNCTION DESCRIPTION] Generate a white noise signal with a Gaussian distribution
[PARAMETERS] duration
[PARAM TYPE DELIM BY TAB] SCAL
[PARAM DESCRIPTION--MULTILINES] duration of the signal to generate
[PARAM UNIT--MULTILINES] millisecond
[NOTES] Unlike noise, the amplitude of gnoise is not bounded between -1 and 1. &rarr; Scale down the output appropriately to avoid clipping at &plusmn;1.
