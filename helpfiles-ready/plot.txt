[FUNCTION NAME] plot
[STATIC] 2
[FUNCTION DESCRIPTION] Plot the data
[PARAMETERS]  _handle x y="" opt=""
[PARAM TYPE DELIM BY TAB] HGO	VECT or AUD	VECT or AUD	TXT
[PARAM DESCRIPTION--MULTILINES] handle to the figure window or the axes 
x-data
y-data
plot option string--specifying color marker and line style (see notes)
[PARAM UNIT--MULTILINES]


n/a
[NOTES] If #p1 is omitted, this function creates a new figure window and plots 
If #p3 is specified, #p3 is plotted as a function of #p2.
If #p3 is omitted, #p2 is plotted with the index (if non-audio) or the time (if audio) on the x-axis.
#p4 is a text not exceeding 4 characters specifying the color, the marker type and the line style.<br>Color: r(ed) g(reen) b(lue) y(ellow) c(yan) m(agenta) h(white) (blac)k<br>Marker: o circle s square . point * asterisk x cross + plussign d diamond ^ upward-pointingtriangle v downward-pointingtriangle > right-pointingtriangle < left-pointingtriangle<br>Linestyle: - solid : dotted -- dashed -. dash-dot
The default marker type is . (point)
The default line style is solid, but if only the marker type is specified, the line style will become none (i.e., in order to make the line tyle none, specify ".")
The default color is blue
All the other graphic properties can be directly manipulated with the relevant member variables.
[EXAMPLES] plot(x) // plot x with the default parameters
plot(x,y) // plot y as a function of x with the default parameters
plot(x,"r") // plot x with the red line
plot(x,"o") // plot x with the marker "o" and no line
plot(x,"*":) // plot x with the marker "*" and dotted line
plot(x,y,"o") // plot y as a function of x with the marker "o" and no line
plot(x,y,"*:") // plot y as a function of x with the marker "*" and dotted line
plot(h,x) // plot x in h (either a figure window handle or axes handle)
plot(h,x,y) 
plot(h,x,y,"r")

[OUTPUT ARGS BY TAB] y
[OUTPUT ARGS--MULTILINES] #q1 is the handle to the line object
