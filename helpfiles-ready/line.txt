[NOTES]  This is a low-level version of the plot function. 
This simply adds a line object to the axes, as opposed to following the "nextplot" property in the plot function.
If #p1 is omitted, this function creates a new figure window and plots 
If #p3 is specified, #p3 is plotted as a function of #p2.
If #p3 is omitted, #p2 is plotted with the index (if non-audio) or the time (if audio) on the x-axis.
