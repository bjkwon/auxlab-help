How to make help files (html and pdf)

1. Make chm
2. Import chm in helpndoc
3. Export into pdf and html


1. How to make chm
a. Run HTML help Workshop
b. Open toc.hhc
c. File->Compile... and specify (desired_path)\auxlab.hhp as the project files
d. auxlab.chm is generated in (desired_path).

2. How to import chm in helpndoc
a. Run Helpndoc
b. Import auxlab.chm
c. Change "Title of this help project" to "AUXLAB"
d. Edit "Copyright Â© <Dates> by <Authors>. All Rights Reserved."

Before going into e., edit toc.hhc
			<LI> <OBJECT type="text/sitemap"><param name="Name" value="_tic"><param name="Local" value="tic.html"></OBJECT>
			<LI> <OBJECT type="text/sitemap"><param name="Name" value="_toc"><param name="Local" value="toc.html"></OBJECT>
here, change "tic" to "_tic" (the same for toc). This is necessary to avoid name conflict toc.html, because Helpndoc always generates toc.html

e. Generate Help --- HTML documentation
	Copy created html files to your own folder (for me, it's c:\Users\bjehk\Dropbox\DOCS\helpndoc\html\)
	Note that these html files are different from the html files HTML help Workshop used to create chm, even though file names are the same.
    Update the entire html files to auxlab.org/help and auditorypro.com/help/auxlab	
f. Generate Help --- pdf documentation
g. One html and pdf documentations are complete. There's no need to save the project file in Helpndoc.
