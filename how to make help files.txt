How to make help files (html and pdf)

1. Make chm
2. Import chm in helpndoc
3. Export into pdf and html
==========================================

0. Before running HTML help Workshop
	* To edit the content of an existing file, go to the "helpfiles-ready" directory, find the .txt file and edit it
	* To create a new .txt file, use an existing file as a template and produce it. 
		Or, to create many .txt files, add new functions in init.cpp and run auxhtmlhelp to create multiple barebone .txt 
		files and use the ones necessary as a barebone.
	* auxhtmlhelp 1) generates blank txt files from init.cpp, 2) converts txt files into html files. 
	  These two features are not meant to be performed at one shot (they are essentially separate tasks)
	  auxhtmlhelp will need to be revised to address this weird practice.
	  Watch out where those files (txt and html) are generated. The htmls are used in HTML help Workshop to generate chm.

1. How to make chm
	a. Run HTML help Workshop
	b. Open toc.hhc and add a new function, if necessary; or delete obsolete function.
	c. File->Compile... and specify (desired_path)\auxlab.hhp as the project files
	d. auxlab.chm is generated in (desired_path).

2. How to import chm in helpndoc
	a. Run Helpndoc
	b. Import auxlab.chm
	c. Change "Title of this help project" to "AUXLAB"
	d. Edit "Copyright © <Dates> by <Authors>. All Rights Reserved."

Before going into e., edit toc.hhc
			<LI> <OBJECT type="text/sitemap"><param name="Name" value="_tic"><param name="Local" value="tic.html"></OBJECT>
			<LI> <OBJECT type="text/sitemap"><param name="Name" value="_toc"><param name="Local" value="toc.html"></OBJECT>
here, change "tic.html" to "_tic.html" and "toc.html" to "_toc.html". This is necessary to avoid name conflict toc.html, because Helpndoc always generates toc.html
(Note: to run HTML help Workshop again, _t?c.html needs to be back to t?c.html.)

e. Generate Help --- HTML documentation

Copy created html files to your own folder (for my Surface Pro 4, it's c:\Users\bjehk\Dropbox\DOCS\helpndoc\html\)
Note that these html files are different from the html files HTML help Workshop used to create chm, even though file names are the same.
Update the entire html files to auxlab.org/help and auditorypro.com/help/auxlab	

f. Generate Help --- pdf documentation
g. One html and pdf documentations are complete. There's no need to save the project file in Helpndoc.
